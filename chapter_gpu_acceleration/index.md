# GPU and Hardware Acceleration

## Install packages

For this course, we will use some ongoing development in TVM, which is an open-source machine learning compilation framework. We provide the following command to install a packaged version for MLC course. The particular notebook of **part 1** depends on a CUDA 11 environment.

```bash
python3 -m pip install mlc-ai-nightly-cu110 -f https://mlc.ai/wheels
```

**NOTE: Our build system does not have GPU support yet, so part of codes will not be evaluated.**
